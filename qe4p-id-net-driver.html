                            <p> Hi all I am due to move to new hardware soon, and was wondering about the process for resetting the NIC assignments. Current system has 3 NICs: One on board Realtek (seen in unRAID but not used) Two Intel gigabit cards, which I have assigned in unRAID to eth0 and eth1 by MAC address. The new box (z820) has two Intel NICs, and obviously different MAC addresses. What would be the best option to reset the NIC to MAC address assignments? #1 - Manually edit config files directly just before. Just what it says in the title. There doesn't seem to be much help in this subreddit, but I'm getting desperate. My pen has stopped responding (I have two and they're both charged, so I'm assuming the tablet itself is causing the issues here), and I've been looking all over the place for the drivers. They aren't even on the official website! I'm just worried I may be screwed. was getting constant crashes, tried everything even down to running potato graphics---turns out turning up the fov to max like a bald eagle was the problem---dropping fov down from 105 to 95 and bam not a single crash since. hope this helps someone. I finally got my vfio-setup to where it works almost perfectly (at least for my usage) For desktop usage i use the integrated gpu of my processor and my r9 290 for linux gaming (via PRIME). When launching my vm i made some scripts to bind the r9 290 to vfio-pci module, pass it to the vm and rebind it to the host after the vm has been closed. All is working fine.at least when using gnome or i3 wm (didn't try any other yet) but when i try to rebind the gpu while running xfce4 my system freez. 
I currently have the latest Debian image flashed to the eMMC of my BeagleBone Black. On boot, the rootfs and BEAGLEBONE drives appear. I am not able to access 192.168.7.2 through a web browser or ssh. ifconfig shows a strange interface, enxd03972401505, in place of usb0. My guess is this is the root of the problem, but I could use some guidance on why this is happening and how to fix it. Some more background that may be relevant: I attempted to flash Ubuntu 14.04 to the eMMC but the process. As requested.

Hello Agents, amp#x200B; I, like so many others, have been experiencing ludicrous amounts of game crashes in both DX11 and DX12 since the first patch a week into launch. I have spent the past 2 weeks or so trying every suggested fix here and on the forums to no avail and even got so far into the weeds that I had to format and start over twice due to completely destabilizing my PC.
